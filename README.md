Shader development has always been a huge interest of mine ever since I first laid eyes on Chocapic13's Shaders. I decided to drop that passion for a while since I wasn't really learning anything. After experiencing the wonderful work of art, Complementary, I wanted to try and challenge myself and create something I truly love while persevering through college.

Allium is an edit of Complementary Unbound focused on bringing my creative vision to life. Emphasizing the beauty in colors and effects, all while staying as performant as it can be. With Allium, I hope to deliver a unique style and aesthetic that pushes my creativity to it's limits.

### Huge Thanks
- Emin for using Complementary as the base shader
- Query for their wonderful LUT code
- Xonk & Chocapic13 for SSRTGI code from Bliss Shaders
