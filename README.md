My take on the wonderful work of art, Complementary, that focuses on beauty and aesthetics with the use of LUTs and much more!
Throughout my college journey, I will be using this shader as my main focus for learning graphics development.

# Features
- LUTs
- HDR Tonemapping
- Color Grading
- Volumetric Clouds
- Volumetric Fog and Light Shafts
- Atmospheric Scattering (def not physically accurate lol)
- and so much more!

# Credits
- Emin for using Complementary as the base shader
- Query for their wonderful LUT code
