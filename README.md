Allium is an edit of Complementary Unbound focused on bringing my creative vision to life. Emphasizing the beauty in colors and effects, all while staying as performant as it can be. With Allium, I hope to deliver a unique style and aesthetic that pushes my creativity to it's limits.

v2.0 has received a massive overhaul on it's overall look, feel and atmospherics. Even though this shader is fairly young and hasn't received much updates, I began to feel as if the appearance was not going in a direction that I had originally intended. So I've spent the past couple of months revisioning what Allium should be, and what should have been. Although it's not perfect, I have been fairly happy with how it has turned out and wanted to share it with you all. Cheers! :)

### Huge Thanks
