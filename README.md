# Allium Shaders

A lightweight minecraft shader that focuses on beauty and aesthetics with the use of LUTs, Color Grading, Tonemapping and much more!

The shader is currently in its earliest stages, with not much to offer.
But here are some features I want to add throughout my journey:
- LUTs
- Color Grading
- HDR Tonemapping
- Depth of Field
- Bloom
- TAA
- PCSS
- Screenspace Reflections
