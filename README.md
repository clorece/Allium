# clorece-shader
This is a project I began to start learning about video game graphics and how they work. 
For this shaderpack I aim to give life and color into Minecraft. The feel of this shaderpack could change but as of now I am aiming towards a bright, vibrant, cool-ish feel to the shader.
The project is sort of a side hobby while I take classes in University for the next 4 years in hopes to land a career in Video Game Development, specifically graphics.
I will try to post updates consistently, as of now this shader is in it's very early stages and will improve over time as I learn new ways of making cool effects.
There will be no licenses on this project as some of the code in this shader are used from different sources like shadertoy that I have provided.
