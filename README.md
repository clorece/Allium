# Allium Shaders

![2025-06-10_21 28 15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/082a024d-8ac7-459c-8988-0c303a6881df)

Shader development has always been a huge interest of mine ever since I first laid eyes on Chocapic13's Shaders. I decided to drop that passion for a while since I wasn't really learning anything. After experiencing the wonderful work of art, Complementary, I wanted to try and challenge myself and create something I truly love while persevering through college.

Allium is a shader focused on bringing my creative vision to life. Emphasizing the beauty in colors and effects, all while staying as performant as it can be. With Allium, I hope to deliver a unique style and aesthetic that pushes my creativity to it's limits.

### Huge Thanks
- Emin for using Complementary as the base shader
- Query for their wonderful LUT code
