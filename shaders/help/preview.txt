655 | Block ID mapping
656 | ================
657 | The block ID mapping is defined in "shaders/block.properties" included in the shader pack.
658 | Forge mods may add custom block mapping as "assets/<modid>/shaders/block.properties" in the mod JAR file.
659 | The "block.properties" file can use conditional preprocessor directives (#ifdef, #if, etc.)
660 | For more details see section "Standard Macros" A to I. Option macros are also available.
661 | Format "block.<id>=<block1> <block2> ..."
662 | The key is the substitute block ID, the values are the blocks which are to be replaced.
663 | Only one line per block ID is allowed.
664 | See "properties_files.txt" for the block matching rules.
